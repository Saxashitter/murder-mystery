# Saxa and Luigi's Murder Mystery

Saxa and Luigi's Murder Mystery was made as a mode to counter LeoTM and his scummy practices.
This mode is 100% re-usable, even LeoTM can steal the code from here.

## Why this was made.
Me and my friends got tired of LeoTM's mode, from the OST, to the un-necessary things. We didn't make this to compete, we made this as an alternative for people who also don't like Leo's mode.

## How can I help?
If you can code, try making a pull request for something you want!
If you can do art, compose, etc. Hit me up at **@literally_mario on Discord!**

## Is there an Discord server?
Yes! https://discord.gg/J6yzyJV8Ta

You'll be pinged whenever I'm hosting the mod, you can also contribute directly, and more!
